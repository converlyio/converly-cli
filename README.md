# Converly CLI

Set up and manage [Converly](https://converly.io) conversion tracking from the command line. Built for AI agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex) and humans alike. Every command prints JSON.

Converly tracks form submissions on your website and fires conversion events to ad platforms (Google Ads, Meta, GA4, LinkedIn, TikTok and more), including server-side delivery like Google Enhanced Conversions and Meta CAPI.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @converly/cli
```

This installs the `converly` command. Requires Node 20 or newer.

## Log in

```bash
converly login
```

Opens your browser, you log in or create an account (new accounts start a free trial automatically), and the CLI stores its credential in `~/.converly/config.json`. No API key to copy around. The credential is scoped for agent safety: it cannot touch billing, delete sites, or read stored ad platform credentials.

For headless environments, set `CONVERLY_API_KEY` instead.

## Set up tracking in nine commands

```bash
converly login --signup
converly sites list
converly sites update site_XXX --domain example.com
converly install snippet site_XXX          # add the tag to your site's <head>
converly destinations connect google-ads --site site_XXX
converly handoffs wait hdf_XXX             # finish connecting in the browser
converly flows create --site site_XXX --name "Demo requests" \
  --trigger generic-form --destination google-ads --conversion-id 123456
converly flows publish flow_XXX
converly test-event --flow flow_XXX        # proves delivery end to end
```

To narrow a flow when creating it, use `--pages /contact,/demo` or
`--except-pages /internal` for page paths, and `--form-ids 12,34` or
`--except-form-ids 56` for form IDs. Use `--match any` to accept any rule;
the default is `--match all`. Run `converly triggers` to see which filters
each tool supports. With no filter flags, no filter settings are sent.

Both `flows create` and `flows update` accept `--filters-json` with the
public filters object, for example
`--filters-json '{"match":"all","list":[{"field":"form","op":"only","values":[{"id":"12"}]}]}'`.
On update, this changes only the filters. Use `--filters-json` without the
shortcut filter flags or `--json`.

Then keep an eye on real conversions:

```bash
converly events list --limit 10
```

## For AI agents

The agent runbook lives at [github.com/converlyio/converly-agent](https://github.com/converlyio/converly-agent). Install it with `npx skills add converlyio/converly-agent` or `clawhub install converly`. It teaches the full workflow, including the parts that need a human (authorizing the ad platform).

Design notes for agent use:

- stdout is one JSON document for every data command (help and version print text); progress goes to stderr.
- Exit code 0 means success. Errors are JSON on stderr with the API's error code.
- Each POST generates an idempotency key for its own internal retry. To make an explicit retry of the same operation safe across invocations, pass the same `--idempotency-key` value both times.
- Ad platform credentials never pass through the CLI. Connecting a destination returns a Converly-hosted URL where a human authorizes the platform directly.
- `converly login` needs the browser and the CLI on the same machine. For remote or headless environments, set `CONVERLY_API_KEY`.

## All commands

Run `converly help` for the full list, or `converly help <command>` for one command's usage. Anything the named commands don't cover is reachable via `converly api <METHOD> </v1-path>` — the full REST API is documented at [developers.converly.io](https://developers.converly.io).
